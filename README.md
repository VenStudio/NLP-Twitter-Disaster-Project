# NLP Twitter Disaster Classifier

---

## Overview

The NLP Twitter Disaster Classifier is a machine learning project designed to classify tweets as either related to natural disasters or not. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and various machine learning models, this project aims to enhance disaster response by analyzing social media data.

## Database
The database used in this project can be found here [Keggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started)

## Purpose

This classifier helps:
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Automatically detect and flag disaster-related tweets for rapid response.
- **Information Dissemination:** Identify and prioritize crucial information to ensure timely updates.
- **Resource Allocation:** Analyze trends to guide resource distribution and decision-making during disasters.

## Usage

1. **Set Up:** Install the required libraries using `pip install scikit-learn xgboost imbalanced-learn numpy pandas`.
2. **Data Preparation:** Load and preprocess the dataset, extracting features from tweets and hashtags.
3. **Model Training:** Train models using resampled data to handle class imbalance. Evaluate models with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Run Evaluation:** Execute the code to assess model performance and review metrics to choose the best-performing model.
